                <h2>How It All Started</h2>
        <p>SkillShare was born from a simple observation: everyone has unique skills and knowledge, but traditional education systems often create barriers to sharing and learning. Our founders experienced firsthand how peer-to-peer learning could be more engaging, practical, and accessible than conventional methods.</p>
        <p>Starting as a small community project in 2025, we've grown into a platform that connects thousands of learners and teachers worldwide. From cooking enthusiasts sharing family recipes to software developers teaching the latest technologies, our community represents the diversity of human knowledge and creativity.</p>
        <p>Today, we continue to innovate and improve, always keeping our core mission at heart: making learning and teaching accessible, enjoyable, and meaningful for everyone.</p>
